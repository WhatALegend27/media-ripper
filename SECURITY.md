## Supported Versions

The most recent release will always receive security updates. 

Currently there is no full release, but all alpha and beta releases will be
coded with security in mind.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, reach out to me on discord at @what_a_legend.
It's the best way to consistently get a hold of me.

When I get a vulnerability report, I'll post an update here. I'll then go
through my code and locate any security flaws. I'll post an update again
once the vulnerability has been fixed.
